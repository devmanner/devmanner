Unfortunately, most commercially available ball clocks do not incorporate a 
date indication, although this would be simple to do with the addition of 
further carry and indicator tracks. However, all is not lost! As the balls 
migrate through the mechanism of the clock, they change their relative 
ordering in a predictable way. Careful study of these orderings will therefore 
yield the time elapsed since the clock had some specific ordering. The length 
of time which can be measured is limited because the orderings of the balls 
eventually begin to repeat. Your program must compute the time before 
repetition, which varies according to the total number of balls present.

</p><h2><font color="#0070e8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Operation of the Ball Clock</a></font></h2>
<p>
Every minute, the least recently used ball is removed from the queue of balls 
at the bottom of the clock, elevated, then deposited on the minute indicator 
track, which is able to hold four balls. When a fifth ball rolls on to the 
minute indicator track, its weight causes the track to tilt. The four balls 
already on the track run back down to join the queue of balls waiting at the 
bottom in reverse order of their original addition to the minutes track. The 
fifth ball, which caused the tilt, rolls on down to the five-minute indicator 
track. This track holds eleven balls. The twelfth ball carried over from the 
minutes causes the five-minute track to tilt, returning the eleven balls to 
the queue, again in reverse order of their addition. The twelfth ball rolls 
down to the hour indicator. The hour indicator also holds eleven balls, but 
has one extra fixed ball which is always present so that counting the balls in 
the hour indicator will yield an hour in the range one to twelve. The twelfth 
ball carried over from the five-minute indicator causes the hour indicator to 
tilt, returning the eleven free balls to the queue, in reverse order, before 
the twelfth ball itself also returns to the queue.

</p><h2><font color="#0070e8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input defines a succession of ball clocks. Each clock operates as 
described above. The clocks differ only in the number of balls present in the 
queue at one o'clock when all the clocks start. This number is given for each 
clock, one per line and does not include the fixed ball on the hours 
indicator. Valid numbers are in the range 27 to 7000. A zero signifies the end 
of input.

</p><h2><font color="#0070e8"><a name="SECTION0001003000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
For each clock described in the input, your program should report the number 
of balls given in the input and the number of days (24-hour periods) which 
elapse before the clock returns to its initial ordering. Output will always
fit in a 64-bit integer.
