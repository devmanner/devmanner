The decimal expansion of the fraction 1/33 is  <img width="31" height="15" align="bottom" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline43" src="202_files/202img1.gif"> , where
the  <img width="18" height="15" align="bottom" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline45" src="202_files/202img2.gif">  is used to indicate that the cycle 03 repeats
indefinitely with no intervening digits.  In fact, the decimal expansion of
every rational number (fraction) has a
repeating cycle as opposed to decimal expansions of irrational numbers,
which have no such repeating cycles.
</p><p>
</p><p>
Examples of decimal expansions of rational numbers and their repeating cycles
are shown below.  Here, we use
parentheses to enclose the repeating cycle rather than place a bar over
the cycle.

</p><p>
Write a program that reads numerators and denominators of fractions and
determines their repeating cycles.
</p><p>
</p><p>
For
the purposes of this problem, define a repeating cycle of a fraction to be
the first minimal length string of digits to
the right of the decimal that repeats indefinitely with no intervening digits.
Thus for example, the repeating cycle of
the fraction 1/250 is 0, which begins at position 4 (as opposed to 0 which
begins at positions 1 or 2 and as opposed
to 00 which begins at positions 1 or 4).

</p><h2><font color="#0070e8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
Each line of the input file consists of an integer numerator, which is
nonnegative, followed by an integer
denominator, which is positive.  None of the input integers exceeds 3000.
End-of-file indicates the end of input.
</p><p>
</p><h2><font color="#0070e8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
For cach line of input, print the fraction, its decimal expansion through the
first occurrence of the cycle to the right
of the decimal or 50 decimal places (whichever comes first), and the length
of the entire repeating cycle.
</p><p>
In writing
the decimal expansion, enclose the repeating cycle in parentheses when possible.
If the entire repeating cycle does
not occur within the first 50 places, place a left parenthesis where the
cycle begins - it will begin within the first 50
places - and place ``<tt>...)</tt>" after the 50th digit.
