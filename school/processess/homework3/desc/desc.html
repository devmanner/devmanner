<h4>Due February 10 (Thursday), 2005, by midnight</h4>
Reading:
<ul>
  <li> Ch 4 in the MPD book</li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.imit.kth.se/courses/2G1915/lectures.html#L6">Lecture 6: Introduction
to Pthreads</a>.</li>
</ul>
Programming environments:
<ul>
  <li> C with Pthread library under Linux, Solaris or Windows.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>To use semaphores, include <tt>semaphore.h</tt> in the
source file and link with <tt>-lposix4</tt>.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li> See example: <a href="http://www.imit.kth.se/courses/2G1915/labs/pc.sems.c">Producer/consumer</a>
program using semaphores and threads (Figure 4.15 in the MPD book). The
given code is lightly different from that one in the text. Note: Under
Windows and Linux, you might need to define SHARED as 0 to be used in
the
sem_init function.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><i>Optional: </i>You may implement the problems in Java using
Java threads and monitors.<br>
  </li>

<h2> Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
  <li> You learn how</li>
  <ul>
    <li> to use semaphores to synchronize threads in a concurrent
program with shared variables</li>
    <li> to use semaphores to control access to shared resources</li>
  </ul>

<b><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">You are to solve

<h2> Problems</h2>
<h4> 1. Synchronization using semaphores. (10 points)</h4>
<font size="-1">The purpose of this exercise is to introduce
you to semaphores in the Pthreads library or/and the Semaphore class
of&nbsp; the java.util</font><font size="-1">.concurrent package.<br>
</font><font size="-1">Consider the following program that spawns three
processes:</font> <br>
<tt><font size="-1">module main()</font></tt> <br>
<tt><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; process P1 {</font></tt> <br>
<tt><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
write("line 1"); write("line 2");</font></tt> <br>
<tt><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</font></tt> <br>
<tt><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; process P2 {</font></tt> <br>
<tt><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
write("line 3"); write("line 4");</font></tt> <br>
<tt><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</font></tt> <br>
<tt><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; process P3 {</font></tt> <br>
<tt><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
write("line 5"); write("line 6");</font></tt> <br>
<tt><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</font></tt> <br>
<tt><font size="-1">end main</font></tt>
<p> </p>
<p><font size="-1">(a) How many different outputs could this program
produce? <i>Shortly</i> explain your reasoning.</font> <br>
<font size="-1">(b) Add semaphores to the program so that the six lines
of output are printed in the order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Declare and
initialize any semaphores you need and add <tt>P</tt> and <tt>V</tt>
operations to the above processes.</font> <br>
<font size="-1">(c) Implement the solution in C using pthreads and
semaphores (Optional: in Java using Java threads and the
java.util.concurrent.Semaphore class).</font> </p>
<h4> 2. Reusable counter barrier (based on Exercise 4.11) (10 points) <br>
</h4>
<font size="-1">Develop an implementation (a program outline) of a <i>reusable</i>
counter barrier for n processes using semaphores. In particular, use
only the following shared variables:</font>
<blockquote><tt><font size="-1">int count =
0;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #counter</font></tt>
  <br>
  <tt><font size="-1">sem arrive = 1, go = 0; #semaphores</font></tt></blockquote>
<font size="-1">Implement the solution in C with pthreads.</font> <br>
<font size="-1">Test the solution with the program that performs matrix
summation using pthreads: <a href="http://www.imit.kth.se/courses/2G1915/labs/matrixSum.c">matrixSum.c</a></font><font size="-1"></font>
<h4> </h4>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>3. <i>The Unisex Bathroom</i> (based on Exercise 4.30) (30 points)</h4>
<p><font size="-1">Suppose there is only one bathroom in your
department. It can be used by any number of men or any number of women,
but not at the same time.<br>
(a) Develop a solution to this problem (i.e. code outline) using
semaphores for synchronization. Implement the outline in C with
pthreads and semaphores (optional in Java using Java threads and the
java.util.concurrent.Semaphore class). Represent men and women as
threads that repeatedly sleep and "use the bathroom". Your program
should allow any number of men or women to be in the bathroom at the
same time. Your solution should ensure the required exclusion and avoid
deadlock, but it need not to be fair.<br>
(b) Modify your answer to (a) so hat at most four people are in the
bathroom at same time.<br>
(c) <i>Optional (for extra 1% bonus)</i> Modify your answer to (a) to
ensure fairness. You might want to solve the problem differently.
(Hint: Use the the technique of passing the baton).</font><br>
</p>
<font size="-1"></font>
<h4>4.&nbsp; <i>Atomic Broadcast</i> (based on Exercise 4.16) (30
points)</h4>
<font size="-1">Assume one producer process and </font><font size="-1"><tt>n</tt></font><font size="-1"> consumer processes shared a buffer. The producer deposits
messages in the buffer, consumers fetch them. Every message deposited
by the producer has to be fetched by <i>all</i> </font><font size="-1"><tt>n</tt></font><font size="-1"> consumers before the producer can deposit another message
into the buffer.<br>
(a) Develop a solution to this problem (i.e. code outline) using
semaphores for synchronization. Implement the outline in C with
pthreads and semaphores (or in Java using Java threads and the
java.util.concurrent.Semaphore class). Represent the producer and
consumers as threads that repeatedly sleep and access the buffer.<br>
(b) Now assume that the buffer has b slots. The producer can deposit
messages only into empty slots and every message has to be received by <i>all</i>
</font><font size="-1"><tt>n</tt></font><font size="-1"> consumers
before the slot can be reused. Furthermore, each consumer is to receive
the messages in the order they were deposited. However, different
consumers can receive messages at different times. For example, one
consumer could receive up to b more messages than another if the second
consumer is slow. Extend your solution to (a) to solve this more
general problem. Implement your solution in C with pthreads and
semaphores (or in Java with Java threads and&nbsp; </font><font size="-1">the java.util.concurrent.Semaphore class).</font>
<h4>5. <i>The Hungry Birds Problem</i>&nbsp; (based on Exercise
4.35) (30 points)</h4>
<font size="-1">Given are <tt>n</tt> baby birds and one parent bird.
The baby birds eat out of a common dish that initially contains <tt>W</tt>
worms. Each baby bird repeatedly takes a worm, eats it, sleeps for a
while, takes another worm, and so on. If the dish is empty, the baby
bird who discovers the empty dish chirps real loud to awaken the parent
bird. The parent bird flies off and gathers <tt>W</tt> more worms,
puts them in the dish, and then waits for the dish to be empty again.
This pattern repeats forever.</font>
<p><font size="-1">Represent the birds as concurrent processes (i.e.
array of "babyBird" processes and a "parentBird" process), and the dish
as a critical shared resource that can be accessed by at most one bird
at a time. Be sure to declare and initialize shared variables that you
use for process interaction and synchronization.</font> </p>
<p><font size="-1">(a) Develop code (program outline) to simulate the
actions of the birds using semaphores for synchronization. Is your
solution fair? Explain.</font> <br>
<font size="-1">(b) Implement the solution in C with pthreads and
semaphores (or in Java with Java threads and the
java.util.concurrent.Semaphore class).<br>
